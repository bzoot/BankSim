JDK Used: JAVA 1.8.0_191
IDE Used: Eclipse Mars.2 Release (4.5.2)
Main File: BankTester
Load File: If you run the demo with eclipse, you do not need to move any file to other place.
		   If you want to run .class file under bin folder, you need to move database.txt to bin\
		   (I already put one copy there). Then use command 'java scu.coen275.banksim.BankTester' under bin folder.
		   If you want to compile yourself, you need to use command 'javac scu.coen275.banksim.BankTester' under
		   src folder, then use command 'java scu.coen275.banksim.BankTester' under src folder(I also put one 
		   database copy under src folder).
Other: The project was coded on a Chinese version Windows. Text file encoding is UTF-8.
